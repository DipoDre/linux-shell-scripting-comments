#### Shell Scripting

It is the process of writing and executing a series of instructions in a shell.
It is used to automate tasks.

#### Comments In Shell Scripting

Comments are lines in a shell script that are ignored by the shell.
They are used to explain what the script does, and are useful for debugging.
They help with communication between team and code maintenance.
